/*
  Script to install PIT
  Usage:
  Call this script either directly or by using the bat/sh script files.
  
  Prerequisites:
  -- PIT must be accessible by the schema you install APEX into. Either becase it is directly installed into that schema
     or because you ran PIT_INSTALL_CLIENT.SQL to grant access to the target schema.
  -- UTL_TEXT must be accessible by the schema you install APEX into. Either becase it is directly installed into that schema
     or because you ran PIT_INSTALL_CLIENT.SQL to grant access to the target schema.
  -- UTL_APEX must be installed. As this installation needs access to PIT as well, requirement 1 is satisfied
  
  Parameters:
  -- 1: APP_USER: database user who owns PIT_UI (Schema of the APEX-Workspace you install into)
  -- 2: APEX workspace name, into which the APEX application will be installed. Needs access to Owner of PIT
  -- 3: ALIAS of the APEX-application.
